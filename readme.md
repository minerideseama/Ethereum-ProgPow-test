If you would like to test ProgPoW and help ETH community, this is the right place to get all the information needed.

I have compiled Ethminer for Windows user for testing of ETH ProgPoW implementation.

Compiled version: ethminer 0.18.0-alpha.3+commit.260c47d2

Source: https://github.com/AndreaLanfranchi/ethminer

I have compiled 2 versions of the miner for AMD OpenCL and NVidia Cuda.

You can also help ETH community by reporting your results to https://progpow.pro/submitGPU.php

Download the miner from Release section: https://github.com/minerideseama/Ethereum-ProgPow-test/releases 

Please also read the FAQ inside, Noob FAQ by a Noob like me, as it might answer some of the possible questions I saw around.

As I have spent many days on it, and other persons too, while this is not our main job and we are not huge miners, any tip will be appreciated!

Andrea Lanfranchi, author of the compiled miner, kudos for him to work on it, also without any financial interest and/or being paid by anyone:

Me, SirAvalon, just a small under 1 Ghs miner, putting all this together (and hard learn compiling, this is almost my first time):

Thank you!
